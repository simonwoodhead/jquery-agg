### jQuery.agg

**jQuery.agg** is a jQuery plugin for dynamically loading Autograph files. If the platform does not support the Autograph Player then a video or image fallback can be specified.

### Goals

- Add some unit tests!
- Avoid browser sniffing possibly


### Supported Browsers

(I need to check!)

- Chrome (all versions)
- IE7+
- Firefox 2+
- Safari 3+
- Opera 9.64+

### History

Autograph is a desktop application that is used by teachers all over the world to help their students investigate and learn mathematics. 

The Autograph Player is a browser plugin (a bit like Flash) which enables files created in Autograph to be viewed in the browser. 

Have a look at [some examples](http://www.mrbartonmaths.com/autographact.htm)

For devices which do not support the Autograph Player we can fallback to an image or video.
